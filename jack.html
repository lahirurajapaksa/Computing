            <p>Quantum computers could be used to solve many of today's pressing problems. They have the unique ability to store
                data as a probability function rather than as simple 1s or 0s. These data are known as "qubits", which is
                short for "quantum bits".</p>
            <p>Today, the very best quantum computers are far from outcompeting simulations on traditional machines. But the
                power of a quantum computer is exponentially dependent on the number of qubits it uses, and therefore they
                are always getting more and more powerful. Soon there will be a point where the power of quantum computers
                surpasses that of traditional machines.</p>
            <p>There are also some dangers involved with quantum computers. Most of today's encryption relies on methods which
                could be easily broken by such a machine without specially developed quantum encryption.</p>
