## 1. Interest of content- *Very good* ##

Good explanation of concepts

## 2. Consistency and quality of visual presentation- *Excellent* ##

Organized and well structured

## 3. Quality of written presentation - *Excellent* ##

## 4. Validity of HTML - *Very good overall* ##

Jack: only 5 errors found

Kelly: only 4 errors found

Sunny: *No errors* at all

Tom: 16 errors found, should be improved

## 5. Evidence of collaboration - *Outstanding* ##

* Author info not written by author: Valid

* Balanced contributions from members: commits made primarily by just two people
Each page is around the same in terms of the amount of content it has, Jackâ€™s page could be a little longer with more information on Quantum Computing. Entertaining home page makes up for any errors.

* Not completed at the last minute: Valid. The website was created over the course of a week with commits throughout the time period

General information is relevant to the topic, although, it could have been better if it has been supported with a few hyperlinks such as a link to youtube or a link to wikipedia for further research. -Yanki\

Couldn't understand the bottom of the webpage. There is some sort of a author information but in a non-structured and not neat way. Removing that would be better. Mainly because you already have author information. -Yanki\
